# Tiny programmes coded in Fudan

## Wordament

A cheat programme for the mobile game Wordament.

I use DFS to find all the words available in the board, with a wordlist of more than 40k words.

This programme was coded before I study the course Algorithm and Data Structure. So there might be some bad code. But it's enough for the game. 

I once got No.1 with the programme. 

## FiveChess

A very simple implementation of Five Chess game. 

It seems to be coded when I first use Intellij IDEA.

## Poker

A tiny toy programme, but interesting and lovely in some way...
